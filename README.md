# jQuery to Vue2
A test of converting a template HTML invoice from jQuery to Vue2

## What I found
In its simplest form, jQuery manipulates the DOM. The initial 3 order lines are hard-coded (they could have been introduced via an array or JSON file) but the in-built functionality of Vue organically provides the structure to enable cleaner code, allowing for a more modular approach.
